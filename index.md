### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    I enjoyed lab 6, part 2 because it involved writing code that checked 
    several conditions in order to calculate the result of a blackjack game. 
    The score of a blackjack game depends on different conditions especially 
    when it comes to the Ace card. To translate this calculation into a program 
    involved utilizing many if statements that check specific conditions and 
    return Boolean values to give the result of those conditions. From these 
    checks the correct calculation for a hand of cards in a blackjack game can 
    be made.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was fun because I learned how to handle a large amount of 
    data in order to accomplish a specific task. In this case I learned to 
    parse a large data set in the form of a two-dimensional vector in order 
    to find a California county and its corresponding population. I accomplished 
    this by utilizing for-each loops to calculate the index of a particular county 
    and using that index found its corresponding population in the next row of the 
    two-dimensional vector.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it introduced me to object-oriented 
    programming. This allows us to represent the real world more accurately in code as the 
    objects we create have both properties and behaviors in the form of member variables 
    and member functions. In this case I created my first class that determined the status 
    of a hi-low guessing game using its member functions to adjust and evaluate its data 
    members.
